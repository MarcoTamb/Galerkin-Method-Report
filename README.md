# Galerkin Method Report 

I had to produce this report for one of my exams. I felt that it is also a good code sample because it shows how I reason when writing code. I include it here as a code sample. 

I was using matplotlib because i had not learned more feature-rich libraries yet, at the time. Today I would try to use [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) or [Holoviz](https://holoviz.org/), and probably integrate [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instead of relying on user text input.
